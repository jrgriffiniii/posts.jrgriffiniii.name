Gleðileg Jól, Good Yule, and Happy Christmas for everyone! I wish you all the fondest holiday wishes.

This post is to hopefully clarify some positions which I have taken over the past two years privately. I have kept these views away from my public identity for a number of reasons, but most importantly in order to ensure that there would not be dire financial consequences for myself and my loved ones by those who swear allegiance to far-left ideologies.

I would prefer to reserve much of the substance of this discussion for several
blog posts (or, ideally, podcasts), but in order to outline several essential
points for my own position, I shall enumerate these briefly:

* I believe in defending nearly limitless freedom of expression. This includes
  for radical or marginalized groups on either side of the political continuum.
* I denounce any and all attempts to undermine the rights of citizens to
  absolute privacy and to their protection from illegal search and seizure.
* I strongly defend the right to private property. Avoiding discussions regarding
  my understanding of what constitutes a "market" and the deep flaws of the *labor theory of value*, I am vehemently anti-Marxist.
* I am and will always be supportive of those who seek to skeptically question and oppose medical mandates and lockdowns. Privacy is becoming an essential human right to protect at all costs, and no citizen should be required to present any part of their medical history in order to participate in society.

While I shall be spending the beginning of the 2022 year aiming to clearly
support the defense of these standpoints, I just wished to ensure that these are
clearly understood as my stances publicly. Thank you for your time and
attention, and I hope to write more addressing these topics very soon.
